# RSA Algorithm Implementation in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the RSA algorithm, including:

Key Generation: Generates two large prime numbers and computes public & private keys.
Encryption: Converts a plaintext message into an encrypted ciphertext using the public key.
Decryption: Recovers the original message from ciphertext using the private key.
ðŸ”¹ Features:
âœ” Generates random prime numbers dynamically
âœ” Uses public key (e, n) and private key (d, p, q)
âœ” Supports custom user input for encryption & decryption
âœ” Demonstrates modular exponentiation & modular inverse for RSA operations

ðŸ’¡ Run the program, enter a message, and see how RSA works in action!
